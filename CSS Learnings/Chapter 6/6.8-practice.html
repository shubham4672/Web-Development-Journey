      <div class="engine">
        An engine or motor is a machine designed to convert one or more forms of
        energy into mechanical energy.[1][2] Available energy sources include
        potential energy (e.g. energy of the Earth's gravitational field as
        exploited in hydroelectric power generation), heat energy (e.g.
        geothermal), chemical energy, electric potential and nuclear energy
        (from nuclear fission or nuclear fusion). Many of these processes
        generate heat as an intermediate energy form, so heat engines have
        special importance. Some natural processes, such as atmospheric
        convection cells convert environmental heat into motion (e.g. in the
        form of rising air currents). Mechanical energy is of particular
        importance in transportation, but also plays a role in many industrial
        processes such as cutting, grinding, crushing, and mixing.

      <div class="exhaust">
        An exhaust pipe must be carefully designed to carry toxic and/or noxious
        gases away from the users of the machine. Indoor generators and furnaces
        can quickly fill an enclosed space with poisonous exhaust gases such as
        hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, if they are not
        properly vented to the outdoors. Also, the gases from most types of
        machines are very hot; the pipe must be heat-resistant, and it must not
        pass through or near anything that can burn or can be damaged by heat. A
        chimney serves as an exhaust pipe in a stationary structure. For the
        internal combustion engine it is important to have the exhaust system
        "tuned" (refer to tuned exhaust) for optimal efficiency. Also, this
        should meet the regulation norms maintained in each country. In China,
        China 5; In European countries, EURO 5; In India, BS-4, etc.,
