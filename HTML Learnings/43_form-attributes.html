  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted. Usually, the form data is sent to a file on the server when the user clicks on the submit button.-->
    <!-- Tip: If the action attribute is omitted, the action is set to the current page. -->

    <!-- The target attribute specifies where to display the response that is received after submitting the form. -->
    <!-- The target attribute can have one of the following values:

    Value	Description
    _blank	The response is displayed in a new window or tab
    _self	The response is displayed in the current window
    _parent	The response is displayed in the parent frame
    _top	The response is displayed in the full body of window
    framename The response is displayed in a named iframe

    The default value is _self which means that the response will open in the current window. -->

    <!-- The Method Attribute -->
    <!-- The method attribute specifies the HTTP method to be used when submitting the form data. -->

    <!-- The form-data can be sent as URL variables (with method="get") or as HTTP post transaction (with method="post"). -->

    <!-- The default HTTP method when submitting form data is GET.  -->
    <form action="/action.php" method="get">
      <!-- After you submit, notice that the form values is visible in the address bar of the new browser tab. -->
    </form>
    <form action="/action_page.php" target="_blank" method="post">
      <!-- After you submit, notice that, unlike the GET method, the form values is NOT visible in the address bar of the new browser tab. -->

      <!-- 
Notes on GET:

Appends the form data to the URL, in name/value pairs
NEVER use GET to send sensitive data! (the submitted form data is visible in the URL!)
The length of a URL is limited (2048 characters)
Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result
GET is good for non-secure data, like query strings in Google

Notes on POST:

Appends the form data inside the body of the HTTP request (the submitted form data is not shown in the URL)
POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large amounts of data.
Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked -->
    </form>
    <!-- The Autocomplete Attribute -->
    <!-- The autocomplete attribute specifies whether a form should have autocomplete on or off.

    When autocomplete is on, the browser automatically complete values based on values that the user has entered before. -->

    <!-- The Novalidate Attribute -->
    <!-- The novalidate attribute is a boolean attribute. -->
    <!-- When present, it specifiest that the form-data(input) should not be validated when submitted.-->
    <form action="/action_page.php" novalidate></form>

    <form action="/action.php" method="post" validate>
      <h2>HTML Forms</h2>

      <label for="fname">First name:</label><br />
      <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John" /><br />

      <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe" /><br /><br />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
      <br />
      <p>
        If you click the "Submit" button, the form-data will be sent to a page
        called "/action.php"
      </p>
      <!-- Only form elements with a name attribute will have their values passed when submitting a form. -->
